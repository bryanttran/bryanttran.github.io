                                                As a lead UI/UX developer, we created a simple
                                                yet familiar user interface while also helping
                                                in parsing data to put into our application 
                                                fluidly.

                                            <p>SlugSearch is a mobile application to let you 
                                                search through UC Santa Cruz's past and current
                                                classes. The application was used as a intro to 
                                                software engineering project. Our aim was to
                                                have an application on mobile to search for
                                                classes since UC Santa Cruz's website was not 
                                                mobile friendly and had many bugs compared to
                                                their desktop application.

                                            <br />

                                            <h4>1. Research</h4>
                                            <p> Our main goal of this project was to allow 
                                                all students attending UC Santa Cruz to browse 
                                                classes efficiently on their mobile device. One of
                                                our main issues in the research stage was to learn
                                                a whole new framework and language. We decided to
                                                use the Ionic Framework since it is capable of 
                                                building on both iOS and Android. By using AngularJS' 
                                                GET and POST requests, we were able to
                                                effectively scrape the UC Santa Cruz's class 
                                                search page. 
                                            </p>    
                                            <p> We had scrum meetings 3 times a week while
                                                one of those times was with the teacher assistant
                                                who guided us with our development and scrum 
                                                terminology. Using a burn up chart, story plots
                                                3 sprints, and a backlog, we succesfully 
                                                developed an application which fulfilled our 
                                                main functions within a span of 8 weeks. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <h4>2. Development</h4>
                                            <p> Our first sprint consisted of scraping the 
                                                big data from the UC Santa Cruz search page, a 
                                                basic UI design, and being able to parse the 
                                                data into our application. Since we were still 
                                                getting used to the Ionic Framework, we used a 
                                                template to get us started for our user interface. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In our second sprint, we decided to start fresh in
                                                regards to front end development. We applied more 
                                                simplistic CSS to the application rather than use a 
                                                template making the application more attractive. 
                                                The team also had succesfully scraped 
                                                RateMyProfessor in order to have that content 
                                                available in our application. We also were able to 
                                                scrape the description for each class such that the 
                                                user can have more details.
                                            </p>
                                            <p> The last sprint mainly consisted of quality 
                                                assurance while touching up our UI/UX design.
                                                We planned reusable tests to confirm the 
                                                functionality of the application was stable. 
                                                We were able to deploy the application on 
                                                a tablet as well as create a shopping cart tab
                                                in order to have a cart to store desired classes.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>3. Launch</h4>
                                            <p>With this being a class project, at the end of the
                                                quarter we gave a presentation of our project, what
                                                we did during our three sprints, and a live quality 
                                                assurance test to confirm the stability of the
                                                application. Some parts of our more luxurious story 
                                                plots did not finish due to time constraints. Some 
                                                of these story plots consisted of push
                                                notifications and a live schedule to see time slots 
                                                of the week.

                                                <p>UCSC Slugbook Exchange is a web application 
                                                    to trade in books of all subjects. The application
                                                    was used as a web application class project.
                                                    The application was created on the Web2Py Framework
                                                    which allowed us to manipulate SQLite databases,
                                                    built in forms, and premade classes from the

                                                <h4>1. Research</h4>
                                                <p> My main goal of this project was to allow all 
                                                    students pertaining to UC Santa Cruz to efficiently
                                                    buy and sell books to other students rather than
                                                    sell back to the school at a ridiculous price. 
                                                    While learning the ins and outs of the Web2Py 
                                                    Framework, my original project was not the same as
                                                    the final outcome. 
                                                </p>    
                                                <p> Using the built in resources of the Web2Py Framework,
                                                    I had planned certain content such as viewing as a 
                                                    guest, viewing as a user, creation of posts, 
                                                    preventing mainpulation of the url, and secure login 
                                                    authentication. 
                                                </p>

                                                <h4>2. Development</h4>
                                                <p> The first thing I did when creating this application
                                                    was map out the pages of what I need with the basic 
                                                    working functionalities. A standard board html page,
                                                    a posts html page, and a functional post button to
                                                    show the board without refreshing the page which all
                                                    send data to and from each page. Utilizing the Web2Py 
                                                    Framework allowed for smooth creation of databases,
                                                    login requirements to post, and creation and deletion
                                                    of posts. After basic functionality was finished,
                                                    I ventured onto user experience content, which some 
                                                    were implemented, and some were not.
                                                </p>
                                                <h4>3. Launch</h4>
                                                <p>With this being a class project, at the end of the
                                                    quarter we gave a presentation of our project.
                                                    Some of the more time consuming features were not 
                                                    implemented due to the time constraints. Some 
                                                    features that were not implemented were FaceBook
                                                    login, a dedicated hosting server, ucsc.edu email 
                                                    check, and direct messaging.

                            Going to UC Santa Cruz has changed me in more ways than one. Leaving home
                            and moving into an entirely different enviornment has allowed me to grow
                            as a person. Views, opinions, and perspectives about almost everything has 
                            changed for the better. The school, the city, and the people have transformed
                            me to be the person I am today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Joining the Alpha Phi Omega national service fraternity allowed me to gain
                            a sense of belonging and grow exponentially. Certain people I have
                            meet through Alpha Phi Omega, I can truely call lifelong friends. Not only 
                            have I created bonds that will last forever, I have created my own sense of
                            individuality. Taking strenuous computer science classes while stepping out
                            of my comfort zone to take leadership positions was a challenging decision.
                            At the end of the day, I am glad of all the decisions I have made throughout
                            my four years of college.

                        <p>
                            Santa Cruz has changed my views, opinions, and persectives of my whole life
                            and I am grateful that it has taken me to a place I would have never been 
                            without this experience.
