                                                As a lead UI/UX developer, we created a simple
                                                yet familiar user interface while also helping
                                                in parsing data to put into our application 
                                                fluidly.

                                            <p>SlugSearch is a mobile application to let you 
                                                search through UC Santa Cruz's past and current
                                                classes. The application was used as a intro to 
                                                software engineering project. Our aim was to
                                                have an application on mobile to search for
                                                classes since UC Santa Cruz's website was not 
                                                mobile friendly and had many bugs compared to
                                                their desktop application.

                                            <br />

                                            <h4>1. Research</h4>
                                            <p> Our main goal of this project was to allow 
                                                all students attending UC Santa Cruz to browse 
                                                classes efficiently on their mobile device. One of
                                                our main issues in the research stage was to learn
                                                a whole new framework and language. We decided to
                                                use the Ionic Framework since it is capable of 
                                                building on both iOS and Android. By using AngularJS' GET and POST requests, we were able to
                                                effectively scrape the UC Santa Cruz's class 
                                                search page. 
                                            </p>    
                                            <p> We had scrum meetings 3 times a week while
                                                one of those times was with the teacher assistant
                                                who guided us with our development and scrum 
                                                terminology. Using a burn up chart, story plots
                                                3 sprints, and a backlog, we succesfully 
                                                developed an application which fulfilled our 
                                                main functions within a span of 8 weeks. 
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <h4>2. Development</h4>
                                            <p> Our first sprint consisted of scraping the 
                                                big data from the UC Santa Cruz search page, a 
                                                basic UI design, and being able to parse the 
                                                data into our application. Since we were still 
                                                getting used to the Ionic Framework, we used a 
                                                template to get us started for our user interface. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In our second sprint, we decided to start fresh in
                                                regards to front end development. We applied more 
                                                simplistic CSS to the application rather than use a 
                                                template making the application more attractive. 
                                                The team also had succesfully scraped 
                                                RateMyProfessor in order to have that content 
                                                available in our application. We also were able to 
                                                scrape the description for each class such that the 
                                                user can have more details.
                                            </p>
                                            <p> The last sprint mainly consisted of quality 
                                                assurance while touching up our UI/UX design.
                                                We planned reusable tests to confirm the 
                                                functionality of the application was stable. 
                                                We were able to deploy the application on 
                                                a tablet as well as create a shopping cart tab
                                                in order to have a cart to store desired classes.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>3. Launch</h4>
                                            <p>With this being a class project, at the end of the
                                                quarter we gave a presentation of our project, what
                                                we did during our three sprints, and a live quality 
                                                assurance test to confirm the stability of the
                                                application. Some parts of our more luxurious story 
                                                plots did not finish due to time constraints. Some 
                                                of these story plots consisted of push
                                                notifications and a live schedule to see time slots 
                                                of the week.
